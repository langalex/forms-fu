forms-fu
======================

this plugin is intended to help in creating forms. its featureset will grow in the near future. for now it can do this:

* adds a required_field?(field_name) method to all the activerecord models. this allows you to automatically mark required fields in a form with a *. required fields are determined automatically from the validates_* calls in the class.

* there is a helper method available in the views that prints out the label for a field with our without star


Example
=======

# user.rb

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :name
  validates_confirmation_of :password
  validates_acceptance_of :terms
  
  required_fields << [:login] # in case you want to mark additional fields as required
end

User.required_field?(:name) # => true
User.required_field?(:login) # => true
User.required_field?(:password_confirmation) # => true
User.required_field?(:terms) # => true
User.required_field?(:email) # => false


# users/new.html.erb

<%= label_fu @user, :name %> # => <label for="user_name">Name *</label>
<%= label_fu @user, :email %> # => <label for="user_email">Email</label>
